            <p>Now arriving: Arrive, a package tracker that simplifies every online delivery from virtual checkout to your doorstep. </p>
            <p>Spun out of the innovation labs at Shopify, Arrive is an iOS app designed to automatically track and notify users of all online shipments coming their way. The service is built atop Shopify‚Äôs existing ecommerce platform to cater to consumers who purchase from Shopify vendors and even those shopping independently of Shopify‚Äôs core ecommerce ecosystem. The app is a package tracking personal assistant in your pocket that knows what you bought, when you bought it, and when it‚Äôs arriving. </p>
            <p>There are some products that completely, unequivocally transform the way we live and interact with the world around us: Uber has upended urban transportation and reconfigured how we think about getting from point A to point B. There are other products that meaningfully improve or enhance the way we work: Figma has become the go-to design tool for powerful collaboration across product teams. Lastly, there are products that embed themselves into the flow of our daily lives in a manner that is so breathtaking in its simplicity. They offer a superior experience that solves an everyday problem or nuisance so effortlessly, it makes you wonder where this product has been the entire time. </p>
            <p>For me, that product was Arrive.  </p>

            <h3>The Backstory</h3>
            
            <p>Let‚Äôs rewind a little bit to life before Arrive. </p>
            <p>Whenever you order an item online and expect to have it delivered to your home, you do a lot of obsessive waiting. From the consumer‚Äôs side, the majority of the delivery process is a black-box waiting game: you know you placed the order online, and that the item is probably on a truck in-between your house and the fulfillment warehouse, but you don‚Äôt really know whether or not the package will make it where it needs to be until you finally hear the deliveryman ring your doorbell. </p>
            <p>There is a lot of uncertainty in the process. In some cases, you order an item you need urgently and need a real-time approximation to the time of arrival because every minute counts; it‚Äôs the gift you ordered for your dad‚Äôs birthday next week or the textbook for a class right before the midterm. Your fate hangs in the balance of the estimated arrival time. In other cases, you order an item and it takes so long to get to you that you forgot when you bought it in the first place; it‚Äôs the candle set that was an late-night impulse buy or the shoes that are now out of season. The entire time, you put your blind faith that the company you ordered from will safety usher your package to where it needs to be in a timely manner. </p>
            <p>If you‚Äôre like me, you care about your online purchases, yet you don‚Äôt have the time or energy to obsess over their every move. If you want to monitor the status of your package, your options are limited. Sometimes the website will provide an estimated delivery date, but you find that the estimate is wrong more often than it‚Äôs right. There is traffic, bad weather, and delivery delays that are unaccounted for in the projection, and again, you‚Äôre left waiting. You may have discovered that there are two primary ways to keep tabs on most of your online packages, but have realized that their biggest weaknesses is the lack of centralization. </p>

        
            <ol>
                <li>Ordering off major ecommerce sites or retailers usually means they have their own dedicated apps such as Amazon, which also provides built-in package tracking functionality. That‚Äôs helpful if you order frequently from a certain website, yet becomes a hassle when you need to download a separate app for every website or company you download from just to have built-in tracking functionality. That‚Äôs a lot of time and notifications to keep track of. The chaos of online orders never stops.</li>
                
                <li> The more archaic form of delivery tracking is the SMS notification. Almost always across the board, every online purchase is accompanied by an email confirmation with sparse tracking information. Embedded in the email is a tracking number that links to the specific shipping company the vendor is partnered with: sometimes it‚Äôs FedEx, other times it‚Äôs UPS or USPS. You just can‚Äôt keep track of which is which. You copy each tracking number individually into the shipping company‚Äôs live package tracker, tick ‚ÄúText me delivery notifications‚Äù and dutifully type in your ten-digit phone number each time. You repeat this for every package that enters your inbox and crosses into the unknown. It is an unsustainable chain of text notifications from different packages coming from different places. </li>    
            </ol>
        
            <p>These existing methods are all over the place and offer an inconsistent and unreliable experience for some of your most important internet purchases. That‚Äôs what makes life after Arrive is so much better.</p>
        
            <h3>There's a Lot to Love üíñ</h3>
            <p>
                The key with Arrive is that it understands what the everyday online consumer needs and absolutely delivers in every key aspect of the customer journey. Arrive anticipates each of those steps and makes sure the user stays keen and aware all throughout. From the moment an order is placed online to when it‚Äôs shipped out from a warehouse to when the cardboard box is rattling in the back of a delivery truck, Arrive has it all mapped out This app strips away all of the deadweight of other delivery trackers and focuses on the key questions of when? and where? during deliveries. . The goal here is to make the online delivery process as efficient and elegant as possible for users, and meaningfully succeeds in a powerful and delightful way. 
            </p>
            <p> There are three central elements of this product love letter: Arrive is seamless, timely, and integrated. </p>
        
        
            <h4>Seamless.</h4>
            <h4 class="h4subtitle">Arrive is effortless.</h4>
            
            <p>Arrive syncs with your email inbox and knows about your package before you even have to think about it. Every single online purchase confirmation that lands in the email inbox is auto-populated as a new ticket in Arrive. This email auto-sync feature is the single most powerful aspect of the app. By crawling through the email inbox, Arrive can extract keywords such as ‚Äúshipping confirmations‚Äù or ‚Äúorder update‚Äù to identify key information about tracking numbers, shipping carriers, and product details. The once manual process of keeping up with tracking numbers has now been automated with little effort on the user‚Äôs part. Auto-sync means no more waiting for shipping confirmations and frantically copying over the tracking number to get breadcrumbs about the package progress. It‚Äôs all there, immediate and definite. </p>
            <p>The reason that Arrive succeeds at being seamless is the way it is embedded into the current ordering workflow. Everything that was once manual about keeping track of packages has now become an undercurrent of the online shopping experience. Nothing about the way you order packages online has changed. You still add the items to your cart, input your credit information, and press checkout. Only now, the email confirmation is neatly triaged and filed away in the background. Your delivery expectations shift because of the way Arrive has adapted to your habits. The mobile app model works because users want to know about their packages while they are on the go. Since I have adopted Arrive as my go-to package tracker, I have never had to think or worry about when my packages are coming. I know Arrive has me covered and I just need to look out for the notifications. The process is entirely effortless: connect an email inbox once, and never look back. </p>

            
            <h4>Timely.</h4>
            <h4 class="h4subtitle">Arrive is fast.</h4>
        
            <p>At the heart of online deliveries is the user‚Äôs desire for their packages to arrive quickly; this need for speed confers a sense of immediacy and urgency that the product must also reflect in its design. A delivery tracker needs to be on time and most delivery trackers are notoriously unreliable. Dedicated trackers from shipping companies often present information in a timeline format, a thread of chronological timestamps that read like a clumsy liveblog of delivery updates. It‚Äôs bold of them to assume I can tell the difference between a package leaving a warehouse in Hoboken, NJ at 2:37pm apart from a package that was last scanned in a county 20 miles away from me at 10:23am. I still have no idea when my package is arriving. </p>
            <p>The central strength of Arrive‚Äôs delivery tracking technology is its live map. The map is a clean, beautiful representation of the package journey that plots out every pit stop between arrival and departure. The live map is the perfect complement to the timeline approach found in most other delivery trackers; this eliminates the need for copying and pasting addresses of obscure shipping facilities to another map app to determine where in the world the package is. Pins on the Arrive map geographically correspond to entries on the chronological feed so that every check-in at a shipping facility, every moment of processing or scanning, and every ‚Äúout for delivery‚Äù update is rigorously documented in real-time and real-location. This only gives users more context in terms of place and time so users can estimate how far away their package is from them at any given time. </p>
            <p>The package waiting game is also ameliorated by the frequency of live updates. Arrive sends a notification update at every milestone of the delivery journey so updates are immediately surfaced on the phone. These notifications highlight important states such as ‚ÄúIn Transit‚Äù, ‚ÄúOut for Delivery‚Äù, and ‚ÄúDelivered‚Äù to cut through the noise and avoid any notification oversaturation. This keeps users informed and engaged enough to use Arrive when necessary, but eliminates any frustration or anxiety during the waiting process. This fits perfectly with the seamless and integrated nature of the app, wherein Arrive is simultaneously all-encompassing and effortless. Arrive does all the heavy lifting and communicates back with minimal delays. The ability to know where a package is whenever that information is important to know eliminates the back-and-forth nature of constantly checking for updates. This speed is not to be underestimated and is the common thread that sets Arrive apart from copycats. Estimated arrival times are now visual and more accurate than ever before with proper context. Now, when Arrive says a package will arrive by a certain date and time, it is more than just an internet myth. </p>
            <p>Users trust Arrive and that trust will continue to fortify the way users shop online and position Arrive at the forefront of the next purchase the user makes. The layer of specific geographic detail coupled with frequent real-time updates adds transparency to a process that often feels completely out of the user‚Äôs hands. A normal consumer has no control over their package when it‚Äôs on traveling across state lines on a shipping truck, and Arrive gives users back some of that control. The map transforms the way users think about distance and removes the central mystery at the heart of the delivery problem. Going above and beyond the beautiful map UI is the way Arrive approaches the delivery process as if it were a journey. There is a connect-the-dots animation that traces each pin from start to finish so the user feels like they went on this travelling adventure with the package; it‚Äôs a simple but delightful visual of just how far the package has come. </p>

        
        
            <h4>Integrated.</h4>
            <h4 class="h4subtitle">Arrive is one app.</h4>
        
            <p>Every single package that is bound for your doorstep has a place in Arrive. That means no more forgotten packages that get lost within the depths of an email inbox; every package is tracked and automatically accounted for. Gone are the days where a separate app was needed for each retailer in order to keep tabs on packages. The main screen of Arrive is a dashboard for every inbound package, centralized in a manner like never before. The fact that Arrive is largely vendor-agnostic and supports both Shopify stores and major ecommerce sites like Amazon means it complements and adapts to the shopping habits of every single shopper. No online shopper will ever miss out on their packages again. It almost feels revolutionary. The core tracking functionality of all those other tracking apps out there have effectively become bundled into the magic of Arrive.  </p>
            <p>In addition to its timeliness, Arrive also preserves a sense of history. Every package that has ever passed through the Arrive interface is documented and archived. There is a profile of the original vendor, the live map tracking history, a direct link to the order confirmation, as well as contact information in case anything went wrong. Nothing here is left to chance. Moreover, these online sellers are directly ported into the Arrive app in a separate ‚ÄúShops‚Äù tab that tracks all past orders from a vendor as well as additional trending purchase recommendations for some Shopify stores. The app feels personalized to a shopper‚Äôs personal tastes and habits and quickly surfaces the stores they frequently shop from or places where they would buy from again. </p>
            <p>The direct integration between vendor and customer reframes the way the customer thinks about the online shopping ecosystem. This has strong implications for user retention since users now expect Arrive to easily and seamlessly take care of all their delivery needs. This single app captures and excels at a universal pain point of the ecommerce experience which makes Arrive indispensable no matter when and where users are shopping. Users will return to Arrive again and again so long as Arrive supports the purchases they make online. </p>
            <p>Arrive connects all the dots of online shopping and creates a delivery journey constellation. </p>

        
        
            <h3>A Point of Departure</h3>
            
            <p>
                What truly sets Arrive apart from competitors or alternative package tracking solutions is the way Shopify has positioned Arrive as a great equalizer in the ecommerce ecosystem. Arrive empowers the millions of outbound deliveries occurring each day by not only streamlining the consumer delivery experience, but also by reshaping the framework of accessibility and data privacy for online merchants. 
            </p>
        
            <h4>Democratizing Deliveries.</h4>
        <p>There is no doubt that the pulse of retail has moved to ecommerce. We shop online among giants. While Amazon and Walmart may be titans of online purchases, Shopify stores have pioneered a digitally native approach to buying online. The Shopify platform has opened the door for smaller, independent retailers to stake their claim in ecommerce which ultimately gives the consumer more selection and variety. Shopify merchants are also growing at an incredible pace: according to Shopify‚Äôs 2019 note to investors, there are nearly 800,000 Shopify merchants who have sold over $41 billion dollars‚Äô worth of products online in 2018 alone. With nearly 1 billion shoppers buying from Shopify-powered stores, Arrive has done the almost unthinkable: equalize the delivery experience for vendors and shoppers alike. </p>
        <p>To reinforce a previous user-facing problem, not all retailers have or can afford to have their own specialized ecommerce app. Not only do users not have time to download a separate platform for each retailer, but some independent online retailers simply do not have the resources or capital to compete with their own platform. This inherently puts smaller e-retailers at a disadvantage since their customers are used to the immediate accessibility of a delivery tracker and are frustrated when the results are subpar or beholden to poor solutions that the shipping companies themselves offer instead. Arrive gives small and medium-sized businesses a boost in a competitive landscape in the face of an increasingly demanding consumer. This also feeds into Shopify‚Äôs larger business model of keeping their merchants satisfied and engaged with the end-to-end platform, while passing on the value to the everyday shopper experience. </p>
        <p>Arrive is democratizing the way deliveries happen by ensuring smaller online vendors can compete with larger ecommerce conglomerates in a streamlined and uniform package tracking experience. To a secondary extent, Arrive is brilliant in how it caters to Shopify‚Äôs primary customer base of small, independent merchants. This is all for the benefit of the online consumer and Arrive drives that value by not only providing a superior tracking solution, but also giving all e-retailers equal footing in the delivery space no matter their size. </p>
        
        
        <h4>Protecting Privacy.</h4>
        <p>Arrive, and by extension Shopify, is collecting a wealth of data about consumer shopping habits. By virtue of the type of information Arrive needs to aggregate to present to the user, Arrive knows where users are buying from, what they buy and how much they buy for, and where users are living and shipping their goods. Given the scope of Shopify‚Äôs network of smaller digital-native e-retailers, there is additional nuance in tracking shopping habits of a large but difficult to quantify population of online shoppers. This is data that even Amazon would drool over. The reaffirming part is that Arrive has made a promise to its users that they intend to keep: ‚ÄúWe promise to never, ever sell your data to anyone. Ever.‚Äù</p>
        <p>Other similarly featured competitors do not hold themselves to the same promise. Rakuten‚Äôs Android-based Slice, well, is upfront about the fact that they will manipulate and sell the data collected from users on their service. With Arrive, users do not have to compromise convenience for their privacy. If anything, the data that Arrive collects is used to personalize the experience even further and reinforce a positive feedback loop for shopping recommendations. The personalization makes everyone‚Äôs experience with Arrive feel distinct and tailored to the way they shop online. The commitment to privacy is refreshing and reassuring in a world where consumer purchase data is so valuable, and it would be easy for Arrive to monetize the data outputs of the service they provide to users. Instead, they invest in the user experience and it shows. </p>

        
        
        <h3>Arriving at the Future </h3>
        
        <p>Arrive already excels at what it does, but this is how Arrive can go above and beyond the order of package tracking as we know it.</p>
        <p>To identify opportunities for improving this product, it is important to reframe Arrive in the larger context of its form and function. When I think about the core offering of Arrive, an all-in-one live delivery tracker, I think about the way Arrive has improved a significant pain point in the current online shopping experience and its capacity to reform other process of the process as well. The process of online shopping is more than a cardboard box in transit: it begins with awareness in product discovery, then follows engagement as purchase decisions are made and product are compared to one another, and finally completes with conversion as payment information is typed in and the ‚ÄúCheckout‚Äù button is submitted. From end-to-end, Arrive can bring even more to the table by leveraging key access to resources of its parent platform, Shopify, and augmenting core strengths of its existing product. </p>
        
        <h4>Buy Me One More Time</h4>
        <h4 class="h4subtitle">Need this product again? A friendly reminder that it is repurchase time.</h4>

<p>Arrive already does a fantastic job with notifications and has potential to go even further. At the present, notifications are defined on a per-package basis but some buyers buy certain products more than once. Products like household goods, cosmetic items, or food pantry staples require a regular replacement rate and users will have to seek these items out on separate retailers to repurchase them again. Arrive can simplify the repurchase process for buyers by reminding them of when they last purchased certain items and giving them a nudge when it‚Äôs that time of the year to buy again. There are so many products out there that consumers need to buy again, and it is natural for them to have a home in Arrive by embedding the reorder cycle directly within the app. This is reminiscent of the little date label on a box of opened baking soda: it is a written reminder of when the purchase is made and a visual cue of when it is time to buy a new box of Arm &amp; Hammer. </p>
<p>Once a user has purchased an item once, they can configure their Arrive profile preferences to identify the frequency at which they might buy the item again. The historic log of past purchases on the main screen lends itself perfectly to this configuration: users can quickly determine which purchases are one-time only versus a recurring need. Paper towels can be set to ‚ÄúEvery three months‚Äù and a bag of coffee beans can be set to ‚ÄúEvery two weeks.‚Äù When enough time has past since the first purchase, Arrive will notify the user that they are due for a fresh bag of coffee beans after two weeks or they may be running low on their paper towels supply after three months. These notifications are a helpful and sticky reminder to kickstart the repurchase process. It is an indication that Arrive is listening to a user‚Äôs purchasing habits and harnessing what they learn to make online shopping even easier and more hassle-free. </p>
<p>Since Arrive is also deeply integrated with the network of online vendors and purchasing information, this repurchase process can happen without ever leaving the Arrive app. Once users get a prompt to repurchase, they can follow a one-click process to order again regardless of the product or merchant. Shoppers don‚Äôt have to think about what they need and when they need it again because Arrive has already anticipated that need, weeks and months in advance. This also opens up the door for Arrive to integrate with subscription services that deliver packages at a regular cadence, such as a weekly or monthly schedule. This could create lucrative partnerships with digitally native subscription services that are trending these days or extend the reach of smaller business who rely on recurring customer revenue to drive profit. </p>

    
        
        <h4>Notes on a Purchase</h4>
        <h4 class="h4subtitle">Don‚Äôt remember why you bought this? No more surprises; you do now. </h4>
        
        <p>It happens. Sometimes you buy something, and when you finally receive it in the mail, you forgot why you even bought it in the first place. Maybe it was a late-night impulse buy or maybe it was a gift for a family member that you had no intention of keeping‚Äîyou‚Äôre sure you had your reasons when you bought it, but that doesn‚Äôt quell the surprise when you open the box. Arrive alleviates some of that problem by telling you exactly what you bought in a timely manner, so the surprise is no longer because you lost the email confirmation in the depths of your inbox and never thought about it again. Even then, Arrive‚Äôs description of packages are a little cryptic. Most of the time, Arrive‚Äôs notifications will name the merchant and provide a high-level summary of the first few items contained in the package.</p>
<p>The ability to add a nickname as commentary on packages will add a personal twist to the delivery process. Instead of a clinical readout of the merchant and the package contents, deliveries can be nicknamed so the user will instantly understand what the package entails when it reappears in their delivery notifications. These notes on a package are a quick, pithy reminder of why a user purchased something without having to dig back in their memory to recall their original intents. This feature will also boost to user engagement since it plugs the user directly into Arrive‚Äôs delivery interface and compels them to be more invested than ever before in the successful delivery of their packages. It will make that pink cashmere sweater from the online boutique store feel more personal and gratifying when you know ‚ÄúMom‚Äôs 50th Birthday Gift‚Äù is on its way to you in time for the evening celebration.</p>

        
        <h4>Shop ‚ÄòTil You Drop (Even More Money)</h4>
        <h4 class="h4subtitle">Spent too much money on online purchases last month? Now you know.</h4>
        
        <p>A danger of online shopping is the possibility of an uninhibited shopping spree. Since there are no awkward interactions with cashiers, no handover of cash, or the feeling of carrying the heavy weight of products in plastic bags to your car, every purchase online feels weightless and free of consequence. All it takes is the input of a few magical credit card numbers and the press of a ‚ÄúCheckout‚Äù button to spend money. Endemic to this convenience and simplicity is the risk of overspending or overbuying without paying attention to the price tag. This trend fits handily with a younger demographic that loves buying online but it also attracted by the prospect of wisely budgeting. The fact that Arrive has a historic log of all packages that have been purchased including the total purchase amount, it can be simple to track the total sum of purchase made from a certain vendor or over the course of a month.</p>
<p>Arrive can chart the total purchase amount for packages delivered across time, product categories, and vendors to easily highlight spending among shoppers. A visualization will allow the user to compare their past purchase patterns as they place a new order for perfume or golf clubs this month. Some users track their purchase history by looking at their credit card statements, identifying all purchases made online, and using that to make a judgement call about financing future purchases. By making users more conscientious about the financials of the purchasing behavior, Arrive can address another core need of the shopping experience. A more sophisticated version of this feature will warn users when they are buying too many items that exceeds their monthly purchase budget, or even flag anomalous behavior if too many orders or deliveries are being made in a short period of time. This also lends itself to partnerships with banks, credit card services, or wealth management services as consumers spend more and more money buying online. </p>

        
        <h4>Tracing Every Last Step</h4>
        <h4 class="h4subtitle">How many minutes, seconds until it‚Äôs here? Follow every footstep.</h4>
        
        <p>With the advance of real-time geo-location and tracking in apps with an instant delivery model like ride sharing or food delivery, Arrive has an opportunity to innovate on a microscopic scale. Arrive has already proven to succeed at the macroscopic long-distance game spanning cities and state lines; by converse, there is a different microscope short-distance delivery game also being played here. In the same way that Uber counts down the minutes until the driver pulls up at the pickup location or the way DoorDash lets you monitor every footstep of your Dasher to the front door, customers expect to know when their items are arriving and desire precision down to the minute. While the delivery of a package may require a commitment on the order of days or weeks, there is something thrilling about knowing exactly when a parcel will arrive.</p>
<p>If Arrive embeds itself from the courier and distribution standpoint, then the app can control the granularity of information given to the end user. Arrive can follow the courier as they unload the package from the struck and begin to make their way down the block to your front door. This real-time tracking is not too unlike waiting for a DoorDash Dasher to show up with pad thai takeout. It also adds a layer of specificity of the estimated delivery time down to the minute. Moreover, it can alleviate issues with missing the delivery person if you have stepped out for a few moments or just gotten on a phone call. Those few moments can mean the difference between a happy customer with a new package and a deliveryman routing the package back to the facility. With Arrive there every step of the way, packages will arrive with an unprecedented degree of certainty and accuracy. </p>

        
        <h4>Tracking the Future</h4>
        <p>The most exciting part about future applications for a chameleon, adaptable platform like Arrive is the potential to think beyond physical consumer goods that physically need to be packed in a cardboard box and shipped away on the back of a truck. Here are some ideas for how Arrive can step outside of the (physical) box:</p>
        
        <h4 class="h4subtitle">Digital purchases need a home too. </h4>
        <p>Not all purchases are physical: we buy software bundles and streaming subscriptions and desktop games that don‚Äôt need to be shipped to our real homes, but still have a home on our computers. The way that most people track these purchases is looking at their credit card statements, and since many online services are subscription based, customers remember their purchases by circling dates on their calendar or haphazardly sticking post-its on their desk to remember to cancel after the next month. Arrive can leverage its existing email-crawling capabilities to port digital purchases so users can follow when they started subscribing to Netflix or when their yearly license to Adobe Creative Cloud may be up. </p>
<p>Not only does this echo earlier suggestions in favor of including an in-app repurchase and reminder feature, but also consolidates additional payment and profile elements of a shopper‚Äôs buying habits online and in the real world. A digital purchase log may not be an explicit use of Arrive‚Äôs real-time delivery tracking technology, but it does keenly centralize all of a shopper‚Äôs purchases in a unified history. This can extend to any purchase for memberships in the real world as well by attaching credit card activity with a ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù on Arrive. In this world, a monthly Hulu subscription can happily live next to a SoulCycle class membership alongside an inbound Amazon package delivery. </p>
        
        
         <h4 class="h4subtitle"> Scaling services like a package delivery.</h4>
        <p>
As the online service-based industry grows larger year-over-year, the proliferation of freelance services on the internet like Fiverrr and TaskRabbit draws people that are effectively delivered to your home to repair the leaky pipe under the sink or assemble the Ikea coffee table in your living room. Frequently, the order of these one-off or recurring services are decentralized, but the person doing the job still needs to get to your doorstep at some point. Similar to a package, you are probably anxious about whether they are on their way, when they‚Äôll get here, and when they are about to leave your home again. By tracking services as if they were an inbound and later outbound package, Arrive pushes the envelope on how to logistically track when ‚Äúpurchases‚Äù arrive at a place in real-time. Since Arrive natively adopts a home-centered model given that most package deliveries are homebound, Arrive can scale the home as a destination for both goods <i>and</i> services.

         <h4 class="h4subtitle">Healthcare delivered to your doorstep.</h4>
        <p>Once again intersecting my passions in consumer-facing technology and healthcare, I think this is an exciting place where Arrive can be a thought-leader in how health and medicine can be delivered to a patient‚Äôs doorstep. As the future of healthcare goes digital, the nature of online prescriptions is also a growing field. A built-in repurchasing notification and ordering system would enable Arrive to be a future-forward product that enables the shift of the pharmaceutical industry as it emerges in the online space: patients looking to order their prescriptions online and refill on a regular cadence will be empowered to do so with the technology behind Arrive. The speed and reliability of Arrive makes it the perfect product to become a leader in delivery-based health.</p>

        
        <h3>The Wait is Over: Concluding Thoughts</h3>
        
        <p>The concept of Arrive is simple on paper, but incredibly elegant in its execution. It‚Äôs why I am obsessed, and why I keep coming back to this app every time I spend money online and wait for the package to show up at my doorstep. Every purchase I now make online is with the confidence that Arrive is here to save the day by seamlessly integrating everything I need to know about my packages in one place. The wait is finally over because Arrive has arrived. </p>
        <p>The future of Arrive is bright, a road that is not fully-paved but has quite the journey ahead. By cementing the role of Arrive in the context of a delivery journey, Arrive has the potential to improve across all dimensions of what it means to order a product online and have it shipped to your home with the immediacy and convenience that was unheard of just decades ago. Once Arrive steps outside of the physical box, there is a world of possibility for the product to grow into an indispensable cornerstone of the online shopping experience. </p>
        <p>Arrive is a departure from package tracking of the past and is on its way to tracking the future. </p>
