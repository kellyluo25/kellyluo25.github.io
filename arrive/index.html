            <p>Now arriving: Arrive, a package tracker that simplifies every online delivery from checkout to your doorstep.<p>
            <p>Spun out of the innovation labs at Shopify, Arrive is an iOS app designed to automatically track and notify users of all online shipments coming their way. The service is built atop Shopify‚Äôs existing ecommerce platform to cater to consumers who purchase from Shopify vendors and even those shopping independently of Shopify‚Äôs core ecommerce ecosystem. The app is a package tracking personal assistant in your pocket that knows what you bought, when you bought it, and when it‚Äôs arriving. </p>
        
            <p>There are some products that completely, unequivocally transform the way we live and interact with the world around us: Uber has upended urban transportation and reconfigured how we think about getting from point A to point B. There are other products that meaningfully improve or enhance the way we work: Figma has become the go-to design tool for powerful collaboration across product teams. Lastly, there are products that seamlessly embed themselves into the flow of our daily lives. They offer a superior experience that solves an everyday problem or nuisance so effortlessly, it makes you wonder where this product has been the entire time. </p>
            <p>For me, that product was Arrive. </p>

            <h3>The Backstory</h3>
            <p>Let‚Äôs rewind a little bit to life before Arrive. </p>
        
            <p>Whenever you order an item online and expect to have it
    delivered to your home, you do a lot of waiting. From the consumer‚Äôs side, the
    bulk of the delivery process is a black-box waiting game: you know you placed
    the order online, and that the item is probably on a truck in-between your
    house and the fulfillment warehouse, but you don‚Äôt really know whether or not the
    package will make it where it needs to be until you finally hear the
    deliveryman ring your doorbell. </p>

            <p>There is a lot of uncertainty in the process. In some cases,
    you order an item you need urgently and need a real-time approximation to the
    time of arrival because every minute counts; it‚Äôs the hat you ordered for your
    dad‚Äôs birthday or the textbook for a class right before the midterm where your
    fate hangs in the balance of the arrival time. In other cases, you order an
    item and it takes so long to get to you that you forgot when you bought it in
    the first place; it‚Äôs the candle set that was an late-night impulse buy or the
    shoes that are now out of season. The entire time, you put your blind faith
    that the company you ordered from will safety usher your package to where it
    needs to be in a timely manner. </p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Ordering off of major ecommerce sites or retailers usually means they have their own dedicated apps such as Amazon, which also provides built-in package tracking functionality. That‚Äôs helpful if you order frequently from a certain website, yet becomes a hassle when you need to download a separate app for every website or company you download from just to have built-in tracking functionality. That‚Äôs a lot of time and notifications to keep track of. </li>
                <li>
                The more archaic form of delivery tracking is the SMS notification. Almost always across the board, every online purchase is accompanied by an email confirmation with sparse tracking information. Embedded in the email is a tracking number that links to the specific shipping company the vendor is partnered with: sometimes it‚Äôs FedEx, other times it‚Äôs UPS or USPS. You just can‚Äôt keep track of which is which. You copy each tracking number individually into the shipping company‚Äôs live package tracker, then tick ‚ÄúText me delivery notifications‚Äù and dutifully type in your ten-digit phone number each time. You repeat this for every package that enters your inbox and crosses into the unknown. It is an unsustainable chain of text notifications from different packages coming from different places. </li>    
            </ol>
        
            <p>These methods are all over the place and offer an inconsistent and unreliable experience for some of your most important internet purchases. That‚Äôs why life after Arrive is so much better.</p>
        
            <h3>There's a Lot to Love üíñ</h3>
            <p>
                The key with Arrive is that it understands what the everyday online consumer needs and absolutely delivers in every key aspect of the customer journey. Arrive anticipates each of those steps and makes sure the user stays keen and aware all throughout. From the moment an order is placed online to when it‚Äôs shipped out from a warehouse to when the cardboard box is rattling in the back of a delivery truck, Arrive has it all mapped out This app strips away all of the deadweight of other delivery trackers and focuses on the key questions of <i>when?</i> and <i>where?</i> during deliveries. The goal here is to make the online delivery process as efficient and elegant as possible for users, and succeeds in a powerful and delightful way.
