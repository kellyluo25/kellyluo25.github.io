            <p>My passion for product has always been in designing and building solutions that are uniquely human. Uniquely human translates to thinking about humanity and also being human. I think of all the ways technology has shaped and defined the world as we know it—and all the ways it hasn’t yet as my starting point. I want my impact on the future and larger world to be a kinetic force, an ongoing conversation that reflects the evolving state and needs of the surrounding world without a definite endpoint. </p>
            <p>Looking back at what has driven and motivated me as a creator, a recurring theme has been working to make humans feel a little more human. Whether it be equipping consumers with the most elegant and functional hydration experience to complement their everyday lifestyle at S’well to empowering prospective homebuyers who are searching for a home to put down their roots at Redfin, these are the things that make life more delightful and spirited.</p>
            <p>As product-thinkers we always talk about empathy, and with nearly eight billion people out there, there is no way we can create a perfect one-size-fits-all product for everyone. We must listen to others, the pulse of their wants and needs, and those conversations will render any disparities and dissonance in vivid color. Vision is best thought of on a global scale, but impact, especially meaningful impact, ought to be thought of on a local scale. </p>
            <p>For me, the most evocative interpretation of this sentiment is considering users from a sociocultural perspective and using technology as a reflection point. I hope to support localization efforts as a framework for accessibility and personalization as I remember the days of trying to overcome a bilingual language barrier by plugging webpages into Google Translate in hopes my parents would finally understand. Good products should shoulder the responsibility of communicating directly to the user in the most native and intuitive manner possible. I want my impact to carry this sense of conscientiousness and intentionality by improving individual experiences, and from there, an impact that reverberates by affecting the most lives in the most consequential way I can.</p>
            <p>My passions are also in consumer-facing technology as it intersects with humans and healthcare. I believe the future is healthcare that is personal and patient-facing, where individuals finally have control over matters of their own heart and health. My aspiration is to lead the forefront of that innovation shift and my bioengineering background has positioned me to think deeply about how to address unmet needs and challenges that face humans. It is the reason I spend hours conducting research in my drug delivery lab as I strive for an equalizing solution that makes medicine more accessible. I think of it as product design with a physiological twist, where I must design for the constraints of my system in terms of biological function. </p>
            <p>In a fast-paced world that never seems to want to slow down, my compass points me toward finding impact in simply being human.</p>
